## Big Picture
* AI is composed of three elements
    * Big Data
        * Autonous Database
        * Data Warehouse,
        * Analytics
        * Data Lake
    * Cloud Computing
        * OCI
        * Perf:
        * Cloud Native
    * Neutral Networks
        * OpenSource

## Deep Learning Era
* untrained (neural Network Model)
* training (learning a new capability from exisiting data) - Data Scientists
    * deep learning framework
    * training dataset
* inference (applying this capability to new data) - App Developer
    * trained model (new capability)
    * new data -> trained model
    * app or service (featuring capability)

## Deep Learning Frameworks: App Dev
* started originally on C++
* now has java, python, and Javascript libraries (multiple js one)

## Modern AI Developer Mindset
* Traiditional (Logic First): Imperative Functional Programming Paradigm
* Data First
    * Operations on Data
    * Better Data = Better Accuracy
* AI (Hard Problems): Experimental Approach (Natural Scientist)
    * Observation - Experimentation - Test Cycle for Model Building
    * Artificial Neural Network is the program and the programmer
* It's all Math
    * Statistics: Probability and Approximation
    * Linear Algebra
## Why DL on the Browser (JavaScript) ?
* Advantages:
    * Ubiquitous: Web, Open Platform, Accessible to billions of users
    * Edge / CLient Computing: No complex setup/installation required
    * Edge / Client Computing: Run Offline
    * HTML5 API's: Camera via WebRTC, Sensors, Speech etc
    * High performance: WebGL, WebAssembly*, WebGPU*
* Challenges: 
    * Single Threaded Environment
    * Cross Browser Compatibility
## Machine (Deep Leraning Approaches)
* Supervised Learning
    * classification 
    * regression
* Unsupervised Learning
    * clustering
    * dimensionality
* Reinforcement Learning
## Typical Machine Learning Workflow
    * Define problem
    * Build neural net architecture
    * Collect (or add more) data
    * Train for an epoch
    * is error on training data decresing?
        * yes -> is error on validation data decreasing
        * no ->
    * perform well on training data?

## ML Goal: Improve Cost/Loss Function aka Minimize Error
* Gradient Descent Algorithm
* Parameter Optimization
* Algorithms Efficiency
* Improve DataSets
