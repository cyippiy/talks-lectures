# Machine Learning for Modern Javascript Developer  2/27/19
## Lecturer: Suyash Joshi from Oracle

## Big Picture
* AI is composed of three elements
    * Big Data
        * Autonous Database
        * Data Warehouse,
        * Analytics
        * Data Lake
    * Cloud Computing
        * OCI
        * Perf:
        * Cloud Native
    * Neutral Networks
        * OpenSource

## Deep Learning Era
* untrained (neural Network Model)
* training (learning a new capability from exisiting data) - Data Scientists
    * deep learning framework
    * training dataset
* inference (applying this capability to new data) - App Developer
    * trained model (new capability)
    * new data -> trained model
    * app or service (featuring capability)

## Deep Learning Frameworks: App Dev
* started originally on C++
* now has java, python, and Javascript libraries (multiple js one)

## Modern AI Developer Mindset
* Traiditional (Logic First): Imperative Functional Programming Paradigm
* Data First
    * Operations on Data
    * Better Data = Better Accuracy
* AI (Hard Problems): Experimental Approach (Natural Scientist)
    * Observation - Experimentation - Test Cycle for Model Building
    * Artificial Neural Network is the program and the programmer
* It's all Math
    * Statistics: Probability and Approximation
    * Linear Algebra
